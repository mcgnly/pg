## Notes on a Coding Sample
This project was developed for the purposes of providing a sample of work in a short amount of time. As such, there are a bunch of things that I would have included, had the timeframe been longer, including but not limited to:
- tests! unit, e2e
- accessibility
- optimizations: the design of the API isn't ideal, and the client overfetches by a lot as a result. I'm also not doing anything to minimize the size of the client-side app yet. 
- documentation, particularly of the API
- responsiveness: I'm getting a bit of that for free because I'm using MaterialUI, but it could be way better
- analytics: to improve something, you have to measure something first
- data-privacy: with GDPR and the CCPA, it's good to inform users and ask consent for collecting data about them
- props validation
- lots better design and styling

still working on... 
- edit profile, submit tweet
- react code knowing if user is authenticated to switch login/logout prompts and disable link to my-profile if not authenticated
